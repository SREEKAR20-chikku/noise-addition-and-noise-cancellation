# noise-addition-and-noise-cancellation
Noise Addition and Noise Cancellation are important concepts in signal and image processing. Noise addition means intentionally introducing unwanted variations (like Gaussian, Salt & Pepper, or Speckle noise) to test system performance. Noise cancellation involves applying filters (mean, median, Wiener, adaptive filters, etc.) or deep learning methods to remove or reduce noise while preserving the original signal or image quality.

Applications:

Image processing: Enhancing medical or satellite images.

Audio processing: Removing background noise in calls/music.

Communication systems: Improving data transmission reliability.

Research & testing: Evaluating filter and algorithm performance.
